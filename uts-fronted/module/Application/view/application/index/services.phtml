<ul class="about_list">
<li> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i> An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a tax processing number issued by the Internal Revenue Service. It is a nine-digit number that always begins with the number 9 and has a range of 70-88 in the fourth and fifth digit. Effective April 12, 2011, the range was extended to include 900-70-0000 through 999-88-9999, 900-90-0000 through 999-92-9999 and 900-94-0000 through 999-99-9999. IRS issues ITINs to individuals who are required to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) from the Social Security Administration (SSA).</li>
<li> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i> ITINs are issued regardless of immigration status because both resident and nonresident aliens may have a U.S. filing or reporting requirement under the Internal Revenue Code.</li>
<li> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i> Individuals must have a filing requirement and file a valid federal income tax return to receive an ITIN, unless they meet an exception.</li>

<strong>PREPARATION AND FILING OF INCOME TAX RETURNS( INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESS):</strong>

Every Person i.e. Individual/Hindu Undivided Family /Company/ Firm / Association of Person/

Local Authority/ Artificial Juridical person has to submit their Return of Income in case  where

their total Income exceeds the basic exemption limit during the preceding previous year in the

<li> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i>
<strong>INCORPORATION OF A COMPANY:</strong>

The process of legally declaring a corporate entity as separate from its owners. Incorporation

involves drafting an "Articles of Incorporation", which lists the primary purpose of the business

and its location, along with the number of shares and class of stock being issued, if any.

Incorporation will also involve state-specific registration information and fees.

Incorporation has many advantages for a business and its owners, including:

1) Protects the owner's assets against the company's liabilities

2) Allows for easy transfer of ownership to another party

3) Achieves a lowerÂ tax rateÂ than on personal income

4) Receives more lenient tax restrictions on loss carry forward

5) can raise capital through the sale of shares
</li>
<li> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i>
<strong> PARTNERSHIP FIRM FORMATION/RECONSTITUTION AND DISSOLUTION:</strong>

Partnership firms in India are governed by the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. While it is not compulsory to

register your partnership firm as there are no penalties for non-registration, it is advisable since the following

rights are denied to an unregistered firm. Dissolution of a partnership firm merely involves a change

in the relation of partners; whereas the dissolution of firm amounts to a complete closure of the

business. When any of the partners dies, retires or become insolvent but if the remaining

partners still agree to continue the business of the partnership firm, then it is dissolution of

partnership not the dissolution of firm.
</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" style="color:#f0ad4e;"></i>
<strong>APPLYING PAN AND TAN:</strong>

Permanent Account NumberÂ (PAN) is a code that acts as identification of Indians, especially

those who pay Income Tax. It is a unique, 10-character alpha-numeric identifier, issued to all

judicial entities identifiable under the Indian Income Tax Act 1961. TAN is applied through "Form

No. 49B" (prescribed under Indian Income Tax Law). A completed form can be submitted online

at the NSDL website or at the "Tax Information Network Facilitation Center" (TIN-FC). These

centers are established by NSDL, an appointed intermediary by the Central Government, across

India. TAN is required to be quoted in allÂ TDS/TCS returns, all TDS/TCS paymentÂ challansÂ and all

TDS/TCS certificates to be issued. TDS/TCS returns will not be accepted if TAN is not quoted and

challans for TDS/TCS payments will not be accepted by banks. Failure to apply for TAN or not

quoting the same in the specified documents attracts a penalty of Rs. 10,000.
